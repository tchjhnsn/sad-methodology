# Space programme (room schedule)

Listed 2026-10-11 after research: the established method is architectural programming (Peña and Parshall, *Problem Seeking*: goals, facts, concepts, needs, problem statement). States each room's intent and derives its area from use and from the behavioural basis of design (Robert Sommer, *Personal Space*) as well as from codes. Feeds the building model. Research pass 2 (2026-10-11): perceived crowding, persons per bedroom, privacy and layout predict outcomes better than floor area, so area is derived from them, not set first. No single area threshold is settled (physical-methodologies-research-2026-10-11).
