# Set-based concurrent engineering

Researched 2026-10-11 (physical-methodologies-research-2026-10-11): origin at Toyota (Ward et al. 1995; Sobek, Ward and Liker 1999). No construction case studies found yet, so its fit for buildings is assumed. Keep design options open until evidence narrows them; suits uncertain physical work.
