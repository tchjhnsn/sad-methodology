# Spec-as-source

The spec is the only thing people edit; code is derived from it. The third and strictest level in Böckeler's spec-first / spec-anchored / spec-as-source framing.

Evidence so far ([specs-as-source-survey-2026-10-10](/references/specs-as-source-survey-2026-10-10/)): feasible in narrow formal domains (Scania spec2code); regeneration from prose is non-deterministic (Böckeler on Tessl). The strongest empirical result found (Tufano et al.) supports specs as a reasoning step, not as the source. It also applies in a narrow sense wherever rules can be stored as data that a generic engine interprets: the records are the spec.
