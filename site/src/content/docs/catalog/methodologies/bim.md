# Building information modelling

Researched 2026-10-11 (physical-methodologies-research-2026-10-11): information management standardised by ISO 19650; Part 4 allows scaling its checks down for small or simple assets. No outcome evidence found yet on small projects. Model as source of truth for buildings.
