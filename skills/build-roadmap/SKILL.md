  Author or maintain a Build Roadmap deliverable for a project at the Phase
  1B-Final → Phase 2 boundary. The build roadmap is a single HTML artifact that
  decomposes every spec commitment into an itemized build plan with explicit
  ordering (sync / async / parallel), tracks per-line status (✓ done / ↺ partial
  / ⏸ paused / ◐ in progress / pending) with timestamps, and serves as the
  single orchestration surface the operator works against during implementation.
  Per the methodology insight at `_ideas/build-roadmap-and-html-orchestration-2026-05-12.md`,
  the build roadmap is what makes incompleteness visible before dependents
  accumulate. It is also the surface the LLM updates line-by-line during
  sessions as work ships. Trigger this skill when authoring an initial roadmap,
  when a deliverable ships and the roadmap needs an update, when a phase
  boundary is reached, or when a user asks for a "build roadmap," "roadmap doc,"
  "what's left," or "what ships next." MANDATORY TRIGGERS: build roadmap,
  roadmap, what's left, what ships next, what's done, status check, phase
  boundary, line item, deliverables ordering.

# Build Roadmap Skill

The methodology skill for authoring and maintaining the Build Roadmap deliverable that bridges Phase 1B-Final · Articulation Closure and Phase 2 · Implementation. Captured here so the discipline transfers to every project that uses SAD.

## Why this exists

SAD v3 specifies the spec stack (Phase 0 → 1A → 1B) and the implementation phase (Phase 2). What was missing between them is a deliverable that decomposes the spec commitments into an ordered, status-tracked, single-surface build plan. Without it, implementation begins with a pile of specs and no shared understanding of order, parallelizability, or progress. The build roadmap is that bridge.

It's also the **orchestration surface** the operator works against during implementation. Per the methodology addendum: a continuously-updated HTML roadmap that the LLM edits in place during sessions, viewed in a browser by the operator, is functionally equivalent to (and simpler than) the agent-orchestration-OS frameworks proliferating in AI tooling. The roadmap is artifact AND orchestration layer in one document.

## The four-axis structure

Every build roadmap line item answers four questions:

1. **What.** What's the deliverable — bounded, named, attributable to a spec section.
2. **Order.** What precedes it; what depends on it. Some work has hard sequence (schema before seed before page); some doesn't.
3. **Sync vs. async.** Some deliverables block the next one in the session (sync — e.g., typecheck after a schema change). Some don't (async — e.g., authoring an operational runbook in parallel with implementing a feature).
4. **Parallelizable.** Can this run on a separate agent / branch / workstream without contention with the operator's primary track?

The four-axis structure is what distinguishes a build roadmap from an unordered task list. Without it, "roadmap" tends to mean "a list of things to do" and the operator drifts.

## When to invoke

- **At Phase 1B-Final → Phase 2 boundary.** Mandatory. The articulation closure inventory feeds into the build roadmap; ✗ missing items become roadmap line items.
- **When a deliverable ships.** Update the roadmap line to ✓ done with a timestamp + location pointer. Update the status callout if the change is material.
- **When scope surfaces during a session.** Add a new line item rather than mentally tracking it.
- **At every phase boundary.** Roadmap reflects current state at every boundary; stale roadmap = drift signal.
- **When the user asks "what's left?"** or "what ships next?" The roadmap answers.

## Structure

A build roadmap HTML doc has these sections, in order:

1. **Frontispiece** — project name, "Strategic Roadmap" title, authored date, single-operator note, owner.

2. **Status callout** — the most recent meaningful update. Rewritten when something material ships. Tells a reader landing fresh "here's what's true right now." Typically 3–5 sentences. Replaced wholesale on updates, not appended.

3. **Phase regression callout** (when applicable) — if the project is in phase regression (e.g., paused Phase 2 to return to articulation closure), an explicit red-bordered callout names the regression, why, what's paused, what's active.

4. **Table of contents** — anchor links to every phase section.

5. **Status checkpoint** — "what's complete," "what's paused or partial," "what's been authored in the broader ecosystem." This is the project's snapshot. Updated as the phase progresses.

6. **One section per phase**, each with engineering / content / brand / operations / polish sub-sections. Status badges on each phase: Active, Paused, Next, Future. Phase-status colors are consistent across the project's roadmaps.

7. **Per-line item styling:**
   - `class="done"` → green check mark, struck-through or muted, with timestamp + location
   - `class="inprogress"` → ◐ glyph, active session highlight
   - `class="paused"` → ⏸ glyph, muted
   - default (pending) → no class, neutral
   - `class="missing"` → red, "blocker" framing if blocking the phase

8. **How to use this roadmap** section at the bottom — five-ish guidance points on how the operator should read + update the document during sessions. Includes a status legend.

9. **Orchestration pattern callout** — names that this document IS the orchestration surface. References the build-roadmap-and-html-orchestration idea-dump.

## Polity-app reference implementation

`projects/polity-app/product/roadmap-2026-05-11.html` is the reference implementation. Structure has held across the V1 build, the V1 polish work, the phase regression to articulation closure, and back. Open this file as the template for any new project's build roadmap.

## How to maintain the roadmap during a session

1. **At session-start**, read the roadmap. Note current phase status, the active items, paused items, the topmost ✗ missing items.

2. **When work begins on a line item**, flip it to `class="inprogress"` (◐). Add a "started [timestamp]" note in the delv-meta.

3. **When work ships**, flip it to `class="done"` (✓). Add the timestamp + location pointer in the delv-meta. Move the line into the right phase's done-set if the structure has done/pending sub-divisions.

4. **When scope surfaces**, add a new line item to the right phase + sub-section. Mark it as pending. If it's a blocker for current work, mark it `class="missing"`.

5. **When something material ships**, rewrite the status callout. Don't append; rewrite. The callout should reflect "what's true right now," not the project's history.

6. **At session-end**, save the file. The next session reads it; that's the cross-session handoff.

7. **At phase boundary**, the roadmap is the artifact that proves the phase is complete. Every phase has explicit exit criteria; the roadmap reflects whether they're met.

## Discipline rules

These are what distinguish a working roadmap from a stale document.

1. **Update in place, not append.** Status callouts get rewritten when state changes. Don't accumulate an audit trail in the callout — that lives in the per-line timestamps.

2. **No silent line items.** Every line is explicitly done / partial / paused / in-progress / pending. If a line is in an ambiguous state, that's a discipline failure.

3. **One file per project.** Multiple roadmap files = drift. The single roadmap is canonical.

4. **HTML, not markdown.** Markdown works for prose; HTML renders status visually + lets the operator scan at a glance. Use both inline classes + visual treatment.

5. **The roadmap is the orchestration surface.** Treat it as such. The operator reads it between sessions; the LLM updates it during sessions; the team (if any) syncs to it.

## Relationship to other skills

- **articulation-closure** — produces the inventory that feeds the roadmap. Articulation closure exit criteria are roadmap inputs.
- **session-capture** — session-end ritual includes a roadmap-sync check.
- **time-awareness** — used for every timestamp on the roadmap.
- **SAD_SKILL_v3** — parent methodology.

## Methodology amendment queued

Per `_ideas/build-roadmap-and-html-orchestration-2026-05-12.md`, the build roadmap should become a required Phase 1B-Final deliverable in the next SAD revision, with the four-axis structure formalized and the HTML-as-orchestration-surface pattern documented.
